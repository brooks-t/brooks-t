# Brooks Tiffany
## UI/UX Designer | Front-End Developer | AI & Data-Driven UX Strategist

I'm a UI/UX Designer with 7+ years of experience crafting impactful, user-centered digital experiences for federal government, healthcare, and startup sectors. I bridge the gap between design and development, owning the end-to-end product lifecycle from comprehensive user research and strategic design to front-end implementation.

My passion lies in building intuitive, engaging, and accessible solutions (WCAG, Section 508), leveraging modern technologies like React, TypeScript, and AI-powered tools for efficiency. I thrive in collaborative, Agile/Scrum environments and am driven by the mission to create seamless and impactful digital products.
