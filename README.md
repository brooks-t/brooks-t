## Full Stack Web Developer and UX Professional
Over the past decade, Iâ€™ve served around the world with the US Air Force, earned a B.A. in English with a focus on technical communication, and filled multiple roles for a fast-paced software startup. I've earned a M.S. in Human Centered Design and Engineering and have 4+ years of experience working as a UX Researcher at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute where I researched and designed health technologies.

I'm currently earning a certificate in full-stack web-development through the University of Washington with expected graduation of June 2021. In my repos, you'll find an assortment of apps that showcase the different web-development skills I learned in the Bootcamp.

Those skills include:
