## Front-end Web Developer with Professional UX Background
Over the past decade, Iâ€™ve served around the world with the US Air Force, earned a B.A. in English with a focus on technical communication, and filled multiple roles for a fast-paced software startup. I've earned a M.S. in Human Centered Design and Engineering and have 4+ years of experience working as a UX Researcher and Designer at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute where I researched, designed, and developed health technologies.

I earned a certificate in full-stack web-development through the University of Washington in June 2021. In my repos, you'll find an assortment of apps that showcase the different web-development skills I learned in the Bootcamp and on my own.

Those skills include:
- JavaScript

- Next.js
- Git
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind
- SaSS
- Typescript
- Node.js
- Express.js
